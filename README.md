# SimilarityMAP
This application calculates document similarities using BERT embeddings. It reads text files from a folder, computes pairwise similarities, and generates a heat-map to visualise the results. The similarity matrix can be saved as a CSV file, and the heat-map as an image.
<br />
App.py -> Tkinter Application requires a folder with all the text saved in different files, creates a similarity heatmap of all text files.
get_map.py -> Non GUI application does the same thing as App.py
